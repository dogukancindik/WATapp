    <h1>Work and Travel Requirements</h1>
    <p>
      The Work and Travel (WAT) program is a great opportunity for university students to travel to the United States and work over the summer. However, there are certain requirements that must be met to participate in this program. Below are the main criteria you must fulfill to apply for the WAT program:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Age Limit</h2>
    <p>To participate in the WAT program, applicants must be between the ages of 18 and 26 years old. This age range ensures that the participants are university students or recent graduates, allowing them to make the most of their experience while still being young enough to enjoy the benefits of the program.</p>

    <h2>2. Student Status</h2>
    <p>Participants must be full-time university students enrolled in a degree program. This status is essential as the Work and Travel program is specifically designed for students to gain work experience during their summer break. Additionally, if you have recently graduated, you may still be eligible, but you must apply before a specific time frame (usually within 12 months of graduation).</p>

    <h2>3. Academic Standing (GPA)</h2>
    <p>Most sponsors of the WAT program require participants to have a minimum GPA (Grade Point Average) of 2.0 or higher. This demonstrates that you are a serious student and can balance work with your studies. It is important to check with your program sponsor as some may have stricter GPA requirements, while others may be more flexible.</p>

    <h2>4. English Language Proficiency</h2>
    <p>Since the WAT program involves working in the United States, a basic understanding of English is essential. While there is no formal language test requirement (such as TOEFL or IELTS), you will likely be asked to participate in an interview or language assessment to confirm your proficiency. It is recommended that you have at least an intermediate level of English to ensure you can communicate effectively with coworkers and customers.</p>

    <h2>5. Financial Readiness</h2>
    <p>Financial preparedness is a crucial requirement for the WAT program. Participants must demonstrate that they can support themselves during their initial stay in the United States before receiving their first paycheck. This means having enough funds to cover initial expenses such as accommodation, meals, and transportation. The exact amount varies based on the cost of living in the city where you will be working, but it is typically recommended that you have at least $1,000 to $1,500 available.</p>

    <h2>6. Medical Insurance</h2>
    <p>All participants are required to have adequate health insurance that meets the requirements of the U.S. government. This ensures that if any health issues arise while in the U.S., you are covered. Many sponsors will provide health insurance as part of the program, but it is important to verify the coverage and ensure it meets the required standards.</p>

    <h2>7. Visa Requirements</h2>
    <p>To participate in the Work and Travel program, you will need to apply for a J-1 Visa. This visa allows you to work legally in the United States for up to four months during the summer. The visa application process can be lengthy, so it is important to begin the process early and gather the necessary documents, including an invitation letter from your employer, proof of student status, and your financial documentation.</p>

    <h2>8. Program Sponsorship</h2>
    <p>The WAT program must be sponsored by a recognized organization. These sponsors are responsible for helping you with visa paperwork, providing job offers, and supporting you throughout your stay in the U.S. Make sure to choose a reputable sponsor to ensure a smooth experience.</p>

    <h2>9. Travel Arrangements</h2>
    <p>While sponsors help with job placements, participants are responsible for arranging their own travel to the U.S. This includes booking flights, making accommodation arrangements (if not provided by the employer), and organizing transportation to and from the airport.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Work and Travel program is an incredible opportunity, but meeting the eligibility requirements is essential to ensure that you can participate. Make sure to review the criteria carefully and prepare all necessary documents in advance to ensure a smooth application process.</p>
